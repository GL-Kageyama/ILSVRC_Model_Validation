# ILSVRC Model Validation

This is a validation of image classification using AlexNet, VGG and ResNet.

For testing purposes, it testing with images that are difficult to identify.

Therefore, the original rate of correct answers is much better.

# AlexNet Architecture

AlexNet is an epoch-making neural network model that won the 2012 ILSVRC by more than 10% of the correct answers to second place.

Since the advent of AlexNet, image classification with neural networks has become the defacto standard.

# VGG Architecture

The model was created by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) team at the University of Oxford and was a runner-up at the 2014 ILSVRC.

It is a 16-layer neural network that evolved from AlexNet, with 13 convolutional layers + 3 fully connected layer = 16 layers.

# ResNet Architecture

It is a deep neural network with 152 layers and was the winning model at the 2015 ILSVRC.

By introducing Residual Block and Shortcut Connection, it successfully constructed a deep neural network.
